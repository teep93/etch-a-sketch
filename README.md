Stage 1: 
hardest part of the project. learning to fit </br>
square divs dynamically into a grid with only the use</br>
of flexbox.</br>
learnt more about many css properties and how they</br>
affect each other and a much better understanding</br>
of flex box, loops and dom manipulation</br>
</br>
stage 2: better understanding of event listeners,</br>
arrow functions, foreach method, better understanding</br>
of class selectors and how they do and don't interact</br>
with each other</br>
</br>
stage 3: more practise with css styling</br>
